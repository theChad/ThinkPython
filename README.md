Exercises in section 4.12
* 4.1, stack diagram is an important concept
* 4.3, polygon pies, is relatively straightforward. Might be good to know about 'math.sin(x)', which is in the math.py package. You can use it by having the line `import math` at the top of your python module. Note that the pie slices are isosceles triangles, which can be split up into two right triangles.
* 2,4 and 5 are a little trickier (or more involved, in the case of 4). Could probably be skipped.
