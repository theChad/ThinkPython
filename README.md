Think Python
====

Exercises in the Think Python 2nd Edition, by Allen B. Downey.

#### Chapter 4
Exercises in section 4.12
* 4.1, stack diagram is an important concept
* 4.3, polygon pies, is relatively straightforward. Might be good to know about 'math.sin(x)', which is in the math.py package. You can use it by having the line `import math` at the top of your python module. Note that the pie slices are isosceles triangles, which can be split up into two right triangles.
* 2,4 and 5 are a little trickier (or more involved, in the case of 4). Could probably be skipped.

#### Chapter 5
These exercises all seem good and straightforward. The last one (5.6.3) could be tricky to figure out depending on which fractal you pick.
Also for 5.1, the book doesn't necessarily make it clear that the number returned by time.time() is the number of seconds since midnight on the given start date of the epoch.
